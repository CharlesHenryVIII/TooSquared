* Flat Vertex Attribute
* singertons/simpletons/simplexingtons????

###TODO: 
 * Properly handle chunk location
 * Cube from -.5 - .5 to 0 - 1
 * Moving Lighting/Sun
 * Directional, point, clamped/ambient
 * Octave Noise
 * Combined Noise
 * Profile GPU Upload


 Upload chunk position
 upload block index in place of the vertex position
 find the vertex position based on the chunk position and the block index











#### Noise Solutions:
Mountains:
FBM;
blockRatio /= 100;
Max 10
H = 1
Ocataves = 32
f = 1
a = 1
t = 0

Mountains 2:
FBM;
blockRatio /= 100;
Max 10
H = 1.5
Ocataves = 16
f = 1
a = 1
t = 0
